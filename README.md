# Vanilla Project

Welcome to my vanilla project - a few quick start projects for exploring Java technology stack.
Modules are vanilla in their own nature, simpleton. 
But they could potentially be a foundation for a bigger project. 
Read each module README for further details if any.

If this help you, consider giving a star to this repo! :)
